## Issue Summary

- **Duration of the outage:** June 1, 2024, from 15:00 to 17:00 WAT
- **Impact:** Our beloved website decided to take an unplanned coffee break. All users, which is pretty much everyone, were left staring at a spinning wheel of doom. 100% of users affected. Sorry, world. 🙈
- **Root Cause:** A massive traffic spike hit our database server like a ton of bricks, leading to a spectacular crash. Imagine a car pile-up during rush hour. Yup, that was our database.

## Timeline

- **15:00 WAT:** 🚨 Alarms blaring! Automated monitoring detected our database crying for help.
- **15:05 WAT:** An engineer's "spidey-sense" tingled and they started investigating.
- **15:10 WAT:** Database logs were the prime suspect. Initial hypothesis: Blame the last deployment. 🔍
- **15:20 WAT:** Rolled back the deployment. Problem still there. Panic level: rising.
- **15:30 WAT:** Expanded search to the network and app layers. Nothing unusual. Weird.
- **15:45 WAT:** Customers started complaining. 💬 "Hey, your site is down!" Thanks for the heads-up, folks.
- **15:50 WAT:** Escalated to the Database Admin (DBA) team. They brought in the heavy artillery.
- **16:00 WAT:** DBA team identified a traffic tsunami. 🌊
- **16:10 WAT:** Threw in extra database nodes like lifeboats. 🚣‍♀️
- **16:30 WAT:** The site started coming back to life. Phew!
- **17:00 WAT:** Full service restored. 🎉 Monitored closely to ensure it stayed that way.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:**
Our primary database server got overwhelmed by a sudden traffic surge, leading to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, connections). It was like trying to fit an elephant through a dog door. 🐘🚪

**Resolution:**
1. **Traffic Analysis:** Discovered the source of the traffic surge.
2. **Database Scaling:** Deployed additional database nodes to handle the load. Think of it as adding more checkout lanes at a busy supermarket.
3. **Load Balancer Tweaks:** Configured the load balancer to spread traffic more evenly. No more dog-piling on a single server.
4. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Upgraded our monitoring tools to keep a closer eye on resources.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

**Improvements:**
1. **Scalability:** Upgrade our database infrastructure to handle higher loads and scale automatically. No more manual juggling.
2. **Monitoring:** Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to get early warnings before things go south.
3. **Traffic Management:** Implement rate limiting to tame those wild traffic spikes.

**Tasks:**
- **Upgrade Database Infrastructure:** Move to a more scalable architecture. Think of it as moving from a one-room cabin to a mansion.
- **Implement Auto-Scaling:** Configure policies to auto-scale during high traffic periods. Robots to the rescue!
- **Deploy Sophisticated Monitoring:** Use advanced tools to track resource usage and predict issues.
- **Implement Rate Limiting:** Control incoming traffic to protect our backend.
- **Review Deployment Procedures:** Make rollback processes smoother and ensure zero downtime.
- **Develop Disaster Recovery Plan:** Create and test a robust disaster recovery plan regularly.

## TL;DR

Our website went kaput for two hours because the database couldn't handle a traffic spike. We fixed it by adding more database nodes and tweaking our load balancer. We're also upgrading our infrastructure and monitoring to prevent this from happening again. Thanks for bearing with us, and stay tuned for more robust service! 💪
